Subject: Website Accessibility Enhancements for Colour Blind Users

Dear Mr. O’Reilly,
At DRI Development, we are committed to creating inclusive and accessible online experiences for all users,
and we recognise that your concerns may reflect the experiences of many others. In response, we have implemented
a range of accessibility features designed to support users with colour vision deficiencies. Specifically, we have
avoided relying solely on colour to convey critical information. Instead, we use a combination of bold text,
uppercase formatting, and clear typographic hierarchy to ensure that key messages are easily distinguishable,
regardless of colour perception. Additionally, our website incorporates high-contrast colour schemes—such as red
against neutral backgrounds—to enhance visual clarity and reduce ambiguity between similar hues. These choices are
intended to help users quickly identify important content and navigate the site with confidence. We have also
prioritised the use of strong, high-resolution imagery throughout the site. These visuals serve not only to
reinforce the quality and consistency of our services but also to provide intuitive cues that support comprehension
and engagement for all visitors. We continuously strive to improve our accessibility standards and welcome any
suggestions you may have for further enhancements. Your insights are invaluable in helping us refine our approach
and ensure that our platform remains user-friendly for everyone.

Thank you once again for bringing this to our attention.

Kind Reagrds, 
DRI Development
