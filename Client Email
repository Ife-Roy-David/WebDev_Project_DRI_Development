Subject: Website Development Update & Prototype Preview.

Dear Mr. O’ Reilly,

We are pleased to inform you that the development of your business website is progressing well. In the coming days, we will be submitting both a low-fidelity prototype
and a high-fidelity prototype to outline the proposed layout. As part of the design, we’ve created a logo inspired by your company name, Wheels on Fire - a stylized
wheel emitting flames. It is positioned in the top-left corner of each page. This placement aligns with user reading patterns and enhances brand recall.Our goal is to
deliver a clean, modern, and accessible website. Based on competitor analysis, we have found that simplicity drives engagement. Per your request, we will also incorporate
fragments of dry humour throughout the site to foster a relaxed and relatable tone. Your slogan, Built for Speed, Designed for Comfort, will feature prominently on the
homepage header to reinforce brand values. We also recommend placing your mission statement when ready in the 'About Us' section to build trust and convey professionalism.
An additional 'Best Sellers' page will be added to encourage customer action and boost conversions. At DRI Development, we’re committed to delivering a site that reflects
your vision. Please don’t hesitate to share feedback or suggestions. 

Kind regards,
The DRI Development Team
