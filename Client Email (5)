Dear John,
I hope this email finds you well.

I’m pleased to inform you that we have successfully completed the video presentation of your website, showcasing
its design, features, and accessibility enhancements. The video demonstrates how the site meets your requirements
and highlights key functionalities such as the Personal Collection page, interactive JavaScript features, and 
consistent styling across all pages.

As requested, we ensured the video was kept under three minutes for a concise and engaging presentation.
For your convenience, we have also uploaded the full project files to our GitHub repository. You can access them

forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,
