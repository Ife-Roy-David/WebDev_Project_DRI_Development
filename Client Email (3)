Subject: Website Update – Accessibility Score & New Thank You Page

Dear Mr. O'Reilly,

I hope this message finds you well.

I’m pleased to share a brief update on the development of your website. We’ve made excellent progress and reached a key milestone:

Your site now holds a perfect Lighthouse accessibility score of 100, ensuring it meets the highest standards for inclusive design. This means users with assistive technologies will enjoy a seamless and accessible experience across all devices.

We’ve implemented a new Thank You page that appears after a visitor submits a message via the Contact page. This page provides:

· A clear confirmation that their message has been received

· A courteous note of appreciation

· A link back to the homepage for continued navigation

This enhancement improves user experience by offering immediate feedback and reinforcing trust.

Please let me know if you’d like to review the new page or suggest any adjustments. We’re committed to delivering a polished and user-friendly final product.

Kind Regards,

Dri Development
