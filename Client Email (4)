Subject: Update on Contact Form Enhancements

Dear John O’Reilly,

We’re writing to update you on the recent enhancements made to the contact form as requested.
The form now includes separate fields for First Name and Last Name for better clarity.
A new 'Reason for Inquiry' dropdown has been added with options: General, Feedback, and Technical Support.
The design and styling of these additions have been kept consistent with the existing website layout.

Regarding the data validation and accessibility: 
All fields are marked as required to ensure complete submissions.
The Email Address field validates proper email format.
The Name field accepts only letters and spaces.
The Message field requires a minimum length to encourage detailed inquiries.
Error messages are displayed as clear text alerts at the top of the form, avoiding reliance on color cues to ensure accessibility for color-blind users.

You can view the updated page here:

Please let me know if you have any feedback or further adjustments you’d like to see.

Best regards,
DRI Development
